# DSA Notes

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Notes** repository!

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, and practice problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++. Each folder covers a specific topic with example code and explanations.

## Structure

- **8-Binary_Number_System/**  
  Contains code for binary and decimal number system conversions, including:
  - Binary to Decimal conversion
  - Decimal to Binary conversion (with and without stack)

- **9-Functions/**  
  Demonstrates the basics of functions in C++, including:
  - Function syntax and forward declaration
  - Functions with parameters and default arguments
  - Recursive functions (factorial, binomial coefficient)
  - Prime number checking
  - Palindrome checking
  - Character manipulation

- **10-Pointers/**  
  Covers pointer concepts in C++, such as:
  - Pointer declaration and usage
  - Call by value vs call by reference
  - Reference variables

## How to Use

- Browse each folder to find code examples for the corresponding topic.
- Each `code.cpp` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run using any standard C++ compiler.
- Use these notes for revision, practice, or as a reference while learning DSA concepts.
