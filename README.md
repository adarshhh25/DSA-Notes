# DSA Notes

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Notes** repository!

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, and practice problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++. Each folder covers a specific topic with example code and explanations. The goal is to provide a clear, practical, and hands-on resource for anyone learning or revising DSA concepts.

## Structure

- **8-Binary_Number_System/**  
  Code for binary and decimal number system conversions:
  - Binary to Decimal conversion
  - Decimal to Binary conversion (with and without stack)

- **9-Functions/**  
  Basics of functions in C++:
  - Function syntax and forward declaration
  - Functions with parameters and default arguments
  - Recursive functions (factorial, binomial coefficient)
  - Prime number checking
  - Palindrome checking
  - Character manipulation

- **10-Pointers/**  
  Pointer concepts in C++:
  - Pointer declaration and usage
  - Call by value vs call by reference
  - Reference variables

- **11-Arrays-1/**  
  Fundamentals of arrays in C++:
  - Declaration, initialization, and accessing elements
  - Understanding default values and memory allocation
  - Reading and printing array elements
  - Finding largest and smallest elements
  - Passing arrays to functions (reference behavior)
  - Linear search
  - Reversing arrays (with and without extra space)
  - Binary search
  - Pointer arithmetic with arrays

## How to Use

- Browse each folder to find code examples for the corresponding topic.
- Each `code.cpp` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run using any standard C++ compiler.
- Use these notes for revision, practice, or as a reference while learning DSA concepts.
