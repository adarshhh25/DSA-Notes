# DSA Notes

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Notes** repository!

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, and practice problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++. Each folder covers a specific topic with example code and explanations. The goal is to provide a clear, practical, and hands-on resource for anyone learning or revising DSA concepts.

## How to Use
- Browse each folder to find code examples for the corresponding topic.
- Each `code.cpp` file is self-contained and can be compiled and run using any standard C++ compiler.
- Use these notes for revision, practice, or as a reference while learning DSA concepts.
